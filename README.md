```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "softone-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@cactus-digital-sa/mcp-softone-erp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

      "args": ["-y", "@cactus-digital-sa/mcp-softone-erp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Install in Cursor
Go to: Settings -> Cursor Settings -> MCP -> Add new global MCP server

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor ~/.cursor/mcp.json file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating .cursor/mcp.json in your project folder. See Cursor [MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "softone-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@cactus-digital-sa/mcp-softone-erp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Authentication
First, authenticate with your SoftOne ERP system using the login tool:

```javascript
{
  "registeredName": "your-company",
  "username": "your-username", 
  "password": "your-password",
  "appId": "your-app-id"
}
```

### Available Tools

#### Authentication
- `login` - Authenticate with SoftOne ERP system

#### Data Discovery  
- `getObjects` - Get all available ERP objects
- `getObjectTables` - Get tables for a specific object
- `getTableFields` - Get fields for a table

#### Data Retrieval
- `getData` - Get specific record data by primary key
- `getBrowserInfo` - Initialize browser query for data lists
- `getBrowserData` - Get browser query results with pagination

#### Data Operations
- `calculate` - Calculate field values and business logic
- `setData` - Insert or update records (not implemented in current version)
- `delData` - Delete records (not implemented in current version)

#### Convenience Tools
- `lookupCustomer` - Search customers by code, name, or tax ID
- `lookupSales` - Search sales documents by date range and optional customer

#### Debug Tools
- `debugEncoding` - Test character encoding conversion (Windows-1253 ‚Üí UTF-8)

## Character Encoding

The server automatically converts responses from **Windows-1253** (Greek encoding) to **UTF-8**, similar to PHP's:
```php
iconv('Windows-1253', "UTF-8//TRANSLIT//IGNORE", $text)
```

This ensures proper display of Greek characters in customer names, addresses, product descriptions, and other text fields from SoftOne ERP.

### Testing Encoding
You can test the encoding conversion with:
```bash
# Basic encoding test
npm run test-encoding

# Real-world SoftOne ERP encoding test  
npm run test-encoding-real

# Or run directly
node encoding-test.js
node real-world-encoding-test.js
```

Or use the debug tool:
```javascript
await debugEncoding({ testString: "Test Greek text from SoftOne" });
```
